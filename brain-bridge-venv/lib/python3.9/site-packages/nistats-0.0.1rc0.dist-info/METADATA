Nistats
=======

Nistats is a Python module for fast and easy modeling and statistical analysis
of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data.

It leverages the `nilearn <http://nilearn.github.io>`_ Python toolbox for
neuroimaging data manipulation (data downloading, visualization, masking).

This work is made available by a
`community <https://github.com/nistats/nistats/graphs/contributors>`_ of 
people, amongst which the INRIA Parietal Project Team and D'esposito lab at 
Berkeley.

It is based on developments initiated in the nipy
`nipy <http://nipy.org/nipy/stable>`_ project.
